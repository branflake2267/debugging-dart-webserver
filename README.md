## Debugging

* Run `pub get` to initialize the project.

### Debugging Server with Dart CLI

* Run `dart ./server/lib/server.dart`

### Debugging Server with VS Code

* Use the VS Code Launcher `1. Launch Server`
* http://localhost:8080 - ./ server
* http://localhost:8080/api - ./api server

### Debugging Docker Container
Make sure things work locally in the `eb local run` runner!

* Run `eb local run`
* Open http://localhost:8080

### Debugging Docker Containers
| cmd | details |
| --- | --- |
| docker ps | list the docker containers and [container id]s |
| docker exec -it [container id] bash| /bin/bash into the container. (The container name could be used as well.) |
| eb local run | This will run the Dockerrun.aws.json multi-container configuration  |  



## Init Reference

### Install Dart
The [dart tools](https://dart.dev/get-dart) are required to use this project. 

### Install VS Code Dart Plugin
Install the Dart VS Code plugin. 

Add the program launcher, to launch the web server.
```
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Launch Web Server",
      "program": "lib/server.dart",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "dart"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configure AWS & EB CLI
Configure the AWS CLI and EB CLI utilities.

* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
* [Configure AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
* [EB CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html)

Run `aws configure` to configure the AWS credentials locally.

#### Create Elastic Beanstalk Application
Set up the Elastic Beanstalk application.

Run `eb init` to configure the Elastic Beanstalk hosting config.

* Choose the datacenter that makes sense to you. (I'll choose the default.)
* Choose `Create New Application` and I use the default application name in this example.
* Choose `Multi-container Docker` and the latest version.
* Do not choose CodeCommit in this config.
* Choose the SSH key to setup SSH, if you want to use SSH.

This will create a project file [./.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml](./.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml).

#### Create Elastic Beanstalk Environment.
Set up an Elastic environment for your application. 

Run `eb create dartserver-staging-v1` where `dartserver-staging-v1` is the enviornment name you choose. 

### Docker Config
The `Dockerrun.aws.json` will configure the docker container when deployed. 
In this configuration I won't show how to build and deploy a Docker image to ECR.
